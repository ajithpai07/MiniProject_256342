# Requirements
## Introduction

Calendar application which can tell the day of any entered date

## Feature

The only feature here implemented is that it shows the dates the for any given year in a tabular form as shown in a real calendar.

## Swot Analysis:

### Strengths

Everyone is familiar with a Calendar, so it makes it perfectly natural for a person to get his things organized for better time management.
Many religions depend on the uninterrupted seven-day week, so a calendar makes the days easier to remember and is a go-to for Festivals and Holidays.
Has a huge user base, concluding it will never be out-dated.

### Weakness

Needs alot of work and updates to make it desirable to a user.
Calendars are boring to look to as they only display dates, weeks and months.
No events add-ons and reminders currently.

### Opportunities

Can add various features such as dynamic color changes depending on the season or the month of the Year.
Can add small animations to make it look better and fun.
The priorities will be given to Event add-ons, editing and deleting an event, and last but not least Reminders.

### Threats

Fast moving and creative apps are big time threats to a simple staic calender.
